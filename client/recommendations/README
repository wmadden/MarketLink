Recommendation Service Client
-----------------------------

Dependencies:
  * RVM: http://beginrescueend.com/
  * Ruby 1.9.3: `rvm install ruby 1.9.3`
  * Bundler: `cd client/recommendations; gem install bundler`
  * Gems listed in Gemfile: `bundle install`

Development:
  I've included a minimal development server (server.rb). It compiles CoffeeScript and SASS assets on the fly.

Notes:
  Backbone.js is used for client-side MVC.
  Handlebars.js is used to render views.
  Sinatra runs the server.
  SASS for CSS.
  CoffeeScript for Javascript.
